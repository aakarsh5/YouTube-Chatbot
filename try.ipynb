      "and a pleasure for me. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\n",
      "sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel. And now, dear friends,\n",
      "here's Demis Hassabis. In your Nobel Prize lecture, you propose what I think is a super interesting conjecture that quote, \"Any pattern that can be\n",
      "generated or found in nature can be efficiently discovered and modeled by a classical learning algorithm.\" What kind of patterns of systems\n",
      "might be included in that? Biology, chemistry,\n",
      "physics, maybe cosmology? - Yup.\n",
      "- Neuroscience. What are we talking about? - Sure. Well, look, I felt that it's sort of a tradition I\n",
      "think of Nobel Prize lectures that you're supposed to be\n",
      "a little bit provocative. And I wanted to follow that tradition. What I was talking about there is if you take a step back and you look at all the\n",
      "work that we've done, especially with the Alpha X projects, so I'm thinking AlphaGo, of course, AlphaFold. What they really are is\n",
      "we're building models of very combinatorially,\n",
      "high-dimensional spaces that, you know, if you try to\n",
      "brute force a solution, find the best move in Go, or find the exact shape of a protein, and if you enumerated\n",
      "all the possibilities, there wouldn't be enough time in the, you know, the time of the universe. So you have to do something much smarter. And what we did in both cases was build models of those environments and that guided the search in a smart way and that makes it tractable. So if you think about protein folding, which is obviously a natural system, you know, why should that be possible? How does physics do that? You know, proteins fold in\n",
      "milliseconds in our bodies. So somehow physics solves this problem that we've now also\n",
      "solved computationally. And I think the reason\n",
      "that's possible is that, in nature, natural systems have structure because they were subject to evolutionary processes that shaped them. And if that's true, then you can maybe learn\n",
      "what that structure is. - So this perspective I think\n",
      "is a really interesting one, you've hinted it, at it, which is almost like crudely stated, anything that can be evolved\n",
      "can be efficiently modeled. You think there's some truth to that? - Yeah, I sometimes call it survival of the stablest\n",
      "or something like that, because, you know, of course, there's evolution\n",
      "for life, living things, but there's also, you know, if you think about geological times, so the shape of mountains that's being shaped by\n",
      "weathering processes, right, over thousands of years. But then you can even take a cosmological, the orbits of planets,\n",
      "the shapes of asteroids, these have all been\n",
      "survived kind of processes that have acted on them many, many times. So if that's true, then there should be some sort of pattern that you can kind of reverse learn and a kind of manifold\n",
      "really that helps you search to the right solution, to the right shape, and actually allow you to\n",
      "predict things about it in an efficient way. Because it's not a random pattern, right? So it may not be possible for manmade things or abstract things like factorizing large numbers, because unless there's\n",
      "patterns in the number space, which there might be, but if there's not and it's uniform, then there's no pattern to learn, there's no model to learn\n",
      "that will help you search, you have to do brute force. So in that case, you know, you maybe need a quantum\n",
      "computer, something like this. But in most things in nature\n",
      "that we're interested in are not like that. They have structure that evolved for a reason\n",
      "and survived over time. And if that's true, I think that's potentially\n",
      "learnable by neural network. - It's like nature's\n",
      "doing a search process. And it's so fascinating\n",

      "could be efficiently modeled. - That's right, yeah.\n",
      "- So interesting. - So they can be efficiently\n",
      "rediscovered or recovered because nature's not random, right? Everything that we see around us, including like the elements\n",
      "that are more stable, all of those things, they're subject to some kind\n",
      "of selection process pressure. - Do you think, because you're also a fan of theoretical computer\n",
      "science and complexity, do you think we can come up\n",
      "with a kind of complexity class, like a complexity zoo type of class where maybe it's the set\n",

      "by the P equals NP question and what is modelable\n",
      "by classical systems, by non-quantum systems, you\n",

      "of neural network process and kind of mapped onto\n",
      "these natural systems. So, you know, the things that exist in\n",

      "way of thinking about it. And it sort of fits with the way I think\n",
      "about physics in general, which is that, you know, I\n",
      "think information is primary. Information is the most sort of fundamental unit of the universe, more fundamental than energy and matter. I think they can all be\n",
      "converted into each other, but I think of the universe as a kind of informational system. - So when you think of the universe as an informational system, then the P equals NP question\n",
      "is a physics question. - [Demis] That's right. - And is a question that can help us actually solve the entirety\n",
      "of this whole thing going on. - Yeah, I think it's one of the most fundamental questions actually if you think of physics as informational. And the answer to that\n",
      "I think is gonna be, you know, very enlightening. - More specific to the P and NP question. This again, some of the\n",
      "stuff we're saying is kind of crazy right now. Just like the Christian\n",
      "Anfinsen Nobel Prize speech, controversial thing that\n",
      "he said sounded crazy, and then you went and got\n",
      "a Nobel prize for this with John Jumper, solved the problem. So let me just stick to the P equals NP. Do you think there's something in this thing we're talking\n",
      "about that could be shown if you can do something\n",
      "like polynomial time or constant time compute ahead of time and construct this gigantic model, then you can solve some of these extremely difficult problems in a theoretic computer\n",
      "science kind of way? - Yeah, I think that there are actually a huge class of problems that could be couched in this way, the way we did AlphaGo and\n",
      "the way we did AlphaFold, where, you know, you model what the\n",
      "dynamics of the system is, the properties of that system, the environment that you\n",
      "are trying to understand. And then that makes the\n",
      "search for the solution or the prediction of\n",
      "the next step efficient basically polynomial times, so tractable by a classical system, which a neural network is. It runs on normal computers, right, classical computers,\n",
      "Turing machines in effect. And I think it's one of the most\n",
      "interesting questions there is is how far can that paradigm go? You know, I think we've proven\n",
      "the AI community in general that classical systems, Turing\n",
      "machines can go a lot further than we previously thought. You know, they can do things like model the structures of proteins and play Go to better\n",
      "than world champion level. And you know, a lot of\n",
      "people would've thought maybe 10, 20 years ago\n",
      "that was decades away, or maybe you would need some sort of quantum\n",
      "machines, quantum systems to be able to do things\n",
      "like protein folding. And so I think we haven't really even sort of scratched the surface yet of what classical systems\n",
      "so-called could do. And of course, AGI being built\n",
      "on a neural network system on top of a neural network system on top of a classical computer would be the ultimate expression of that. And I think the limit the, you know, what the bounds of that kind of system, what it can do, it's a very interesting question and directly speaks to\n",
      "the P equals NP question. - What do you think, again, hypothetical, might be outside of this\n",
      "maybe emergent phenomena? Like if you look at cellular automata, some of have extremely simple systems and then some complexity emerges. - Yes.\n",
      "- Maybe that would be outside or even would you guess\n",
      "even that might be amenable to efficient modeling\n",
      "by a classical machine? - Yeah, I think those systems would be right on the boundary, right? So I think most emergent\n",
      "systems, cellular automata, things like that could be\n",
      "modelable by a classical system. You just sort of do a\n",
      "forward simulation of it and it'd probably be efficient enough. Of course, there's the question of things like chaotic systems where the initial\n",
      "conditions really matter, and then you get to some, you\n",
      "know, uncorrelated end state. Now those could be difficult to model. So I think these are kind\n",
      "of the open questions. But I think when you step back and look at what we've\n",
      "done with the systems and the problems that we've solved, and then you look at things that Veo 3 on like video generation sort of rendering physics and\n",
      "lighting and things like that, you know, really core\n",
      "fundamental things in physics, it's pretty interesting. I think it's telling us\n",
      "something quite fundamental about how the universe is\n",
      "structured in my opinion. So, you know, in a way that's\n",
      "what I wanna build AGI for is to help us as scientists\n",
      "answer these questions like P equals NP. - Yeah, I think we might be\n",
      "continuously surprised about what is modelable by classical computers. I mean, AlphaFold 3 on the\n",
      "interaction side is surprising, that you can make any kind of\n",

      "emergent kind of phenomena, you think there's so many\n",
      "combinatorial options that, and then here you go, you can find the kernel\n",
      "that is efficiently modeled. - Yes, because there's some structure, there's some landscape, you know, in the energy landscape or whatever it is that you can follow, some\n",
      "grading you can follow. And of course, what neural\n",
      "networks are very good at is following gradients. And so if there's one to follow and you can specify the\n",
      "objective function correctly, you know, you don't have to\n",
      "deal with all that complexity, which I think is how we maybe\n",
      "have naively thought about it for decades those problems. If you just enumerate\n",
      "all the possibilities, it looks totally intractable. And there's many, many problems like that. And then you think, well, it's like 10 to 300\n",
      "possible protein structures, it's 10 to the 170 possible Go positions. All of these are way more\n",
      "than atoms in the universe. So how could one possibly\n",
      "find the right solution or predict the next step? But it turns out that it is possible. And of course, reality in\n",
      "nature does do it, right? Proteins do fold. So that gives you confidence\n",
      "that there must be, if we understood how physics\n",
      "was doing that in a sense, and we could mimic that\n",
      "process, model that process, it should be possible\n",
      "on our classical systems is basically what the conjecture's about. - And of course there's\n",
      "nonlinear dynamical systems, highly nonlinear dynamical systems, everything involving fluid. - Yes, right. - You know, recently I had a\n",

      "true of most of reality. - Yeah, I've been continuously precisely by this aspect of Veo 3. I think a lot of people\n",
      "highlight different aspects, including the comedic and the meme, - Yes.\n",
      "- all that kind of stuff. And then the ultrarealistic\n",
      "ability to capture humans in a really nice way that's compelling and\n",
      "feels close to reality, and then combine that with native audio. All of those are marvelous\n",
      "things about Veo 3. But the exactly the\n",
      "thing you're mentioning, which is the physics. - [Demis] Yeah. - It's not perfect, but\n",
      "it's damn pretty good. And then the really interesting\n",
      "scientific question is what is it understanding about our world in order to be able to do that? Because the cynical take\n",
      "with diffusion models, there's no way it understands anything. But it seems, I mean, I don't think you can generate that kind of video without understanding. And then our own philosophical notion of what it means to understand then is like brought to the surface. Like to what degree do you think Veo 3 understands our world? - I think to the extent that\n",
      "it can predict the next frames, you know, in a coherent way. That is a form, you know,\n",
      "of understanding, right? Not in the anthropomorphic version of, you know, it's not some kind of deep philosophical understanding\n",

      "or three more years time, that's the thing I'm thinking about and how incredible they will look, given where we've come from, you know, the early versions of\n",
      "that one or two years ago. And so the rate of progress is incredible. And I think I'm like you is like a lot of people love\n",
      "all of the standup comedians that actually captures a lot\n",
      "of human dynamics very well and body language. But actually the thing I'm most impressed with\n",
      "and fascinated by is the physics behavior, the lighting and materials and liquids. And it's pretty amazing\n",
      "that it can do that. And I think that shows it that it has some notion of at least\n",
      "intuitive physics, right? How things are supposed\n",
      "to work intuitively? Maybe the way that a human child would understand physics, right? As opposed to a, you know, a PhD student really being able\n",
      "to unpack all the equations. It's more of an intuitive\n",
      "physics understanding. - Well, that intuitive\n",
      "physics understanding, that's the base layer, that's the thing people\n",
      "sometimes call a common sense. Like it really understands something. I think that really\n",
      "surprised a lot of people. It blows my mind that I just didn't think it would\n",
      "be possible to generate that level of realism\n",
      "without understanding. You know, there's this notion that you can only understand\n",
      "the physical world by having an embodied AI system, a robot that interacts with that world. That's the only way to construct an understanding of that world. - [Demis] Yeah. - But Veo 3 is directly challenging that it feels like.\n",
      "- Right, yes. And it's very interesting. You know, if you were to\n",
      "ask me five, 10 years ago, I would've said, even though I was immersed in all of this, I would've said, well, yeah, you probably need to\n",
      "understand intuitive physics. You know, like if I\n",
      "push this off the table, this glass it will\n",
      "maybe shatter, you know, and the liquid will spill out, right? So we know all of these things. But I thought that, you know, and there's a lot\n",
      "theories in neuroscience, it's called action in perception where, you know, you need to act in the world to really, truly perceive\n",
      "it in a deep way. And there was a lot of theories about you'd need embodied intelligence\n",
      "or robotics or something or maybe at least simulated action so that you would understand\n",
      "things like intuitive physics. But it seems like you can understand it through passive observation, which is pretty surprising to me. And again, I think hints at\n",
      "something underlying about the nature of reality in my opinion, beyond just the, you know, the cool videos that it generates. And of course there's next stages is maybe even making those videos interactive so one can actually step into\n",
      "them and move around them, which would be really mind blowing, especially given my games background. So you can imagine. And then I think, you know, we're starting to get towards what I would call a world model, a model of how the world works, the mechanics of the world,\n",
      "the physics of the world, and the things in that world. And of course that's what you would need for a true AGI system. - I have to talk to you about video games. - Yes.\n",
      "- You're being a bit trolly. I think you're having more\n",
      "and more fun on Twitter on X, which is great to see. So a guy named Jimmy Apples tweeted, let me play a video game\n",

      "- Hmm. - five, 10 years out.\n",
      "- Hmm. - What do you think that looks like? - Well, games were my first love really. And doing AI for games was the first thing I did\n",
      "professionally in my teenage years and was the first major\n",
      "AI systems that I built. And I always wanna, I wanna scratch that itch one\n",
      "day and come back to that. So, you know, and I will do I think. And I think I'd sort of\n",
      "dream about, you know, what would I have done back in the '90s if I'd had access to the kind\n",
      "of AI systems we have today. And I think you could build\n",
      "absolutely mind-blowing games. And I think the next stage, I always used to love making, all the games I've made\n",
      "are open world games. So they're games where\n",
      "there's a simulation and then there's AI characters and then the player interacts\n",
      "with that simulation and the simulation adapts\n",
      "to the way the player plays. And I always thought they were\n",
      "the coolest games because, so games like Theme Park that I worked on where everybody's game experience would be unique to them, right? Because you are kind of\n",
      "co-creating the game, right? We set up the parameters, we set up initial conditions, and then you as the player immerse in it, and then you are co-creating\n",
      "it with the simulation. But of course it's very hard\n",
      "to program open world games. You know, you've got to\n",
      "be able to create content whichever direction the player goes in. And you want it to be compelling no matter what the player chooses. And so it was always\n",
      "quite difficult to build things like cellular automata actually, type of those kind of classical systems which created some emergent behavior. But they're always a little bit fragile, a little bit limited. Now we are maybe on the\n",
      "cusp in the next few years, five, 10 years of having AI systems that can truly create\n",
      "around your imagination, can sort of dynamically change the story and storytell the narrative\n",
      "around and make it dramatic no matter what you end up choosing. So it's like the ultimate choose your own adventure sort of game. And, you know, I think maybe we are within reach, if you think of a kind of\n",

      "super interesting stuff there. So one, the open world built into that is a deep personalization the\n",

      "there'll be something there. It's that the choice\n",
      "of which door you open in an unconstrained way\n",
      "defines the worlds you see. So some games try to do that. They give you choice.\n",

      "- Yeah. - That kind of in a meta way\n",

      "of how to do great science. - Yeah, I think that's gonna be one of the hardest things\n",

      "to come up with a thing that's extremely difficult.\n",
      "- Yeah. - It's easy to come up with a\n",

      "- That sweet spot, right, of basically advancing the science and splitting the hypothesis\n",

      "that's also, you know, falsifiable and within\n",
      "sort of the technologies that you currently have available. So it's a very creative process, actually, highly creative process that I think just a kind of naive\n",
      "search on top of a model won't be enough for that. - Okay, the idea of splitting\n",
      "the hypothesis space in two is super interesting. So I've heard you say that\n",
      "there's basically no failure in, or failure is extremely\n",
      "valuable if it's done, if you construct the questions right, if you construct the experiments right, if you design them right, that failure or success are both useful. So perhaps,\n",
      "- Yes. - because it's splits the\n",
      "hypothesis basically too, it's like a binary search.\n",
      "- Yes, that's right. So when you do like, you know, real blue sky research, there's no such thing as failure really as long as you are picking\n",
      "experiments and hypotheses that meaningfully split\n",
      "the hypothesis space. So, you know, and you learn something, you can learn something\n",
      "kind of equally valuable from an experiment that doesn't work. That should tell you if you've\n",

      "about where to go next. And then you're effectively\n",
      "doing a search process and using that information in, you know, very helpful ways. - So to go to your dream\n",

      "that lay ahead for us to make that happen? We should maybe highlight that AlphaFold, I mean there's just so many leaps. - Yeah.\n",

      "including the open sourcing, everything you've released. AlphaFold 3 is doing protein,\n",
      "RNA, DNA interactions, which is super complicated\n",
      "and fascinating. It's amenable to modeling. AlphaGenome predicts how\n",
      "small genetic changes. Like if we think about single mutations, how they link to actual function? So those, it seems like\n",
      "it's creeping along, - Yes.\n",
      "- to sophisticated, to much more complicated\n",
      "things like a cell, but a cell has a lot of\n",
      "really complicated components. - Yeah. So what I've tried to do\n",
      "throughout my career is I have these really grand dreams and then I try to, as you've noticed, and then I try to break, but I try to break them\n",
      "down any, you know, it's easy to have a kind\n",
      "of a crazy ambitious dream. But the trick is how do you break it down into manageable, achievable, interim steps that are meaningful and\n",
      "useful in their own right. And so virtual cell, which is what I call the\n",
      "project of modeling a cell, I've had this idea, you know, of wanting to do that for\n",
      "maybe more like 25 years. And I used to talk with Paul Nurse, who is a bit of a mentor\n",
      "of mine in biology. He runs the, you know,\n",
      "founded the Crick Institute and won the Nobel prize in 2001. We've been talking about it since, you know, before, you know, in the '90s. And I used to come back\n",
      "to every five years like, what would you need to model\n",
      "of the full internals of a cell so that you could do\n",
      "experiments on the virtual cell and what those experiment,\n",
      "you know, in silico. And those predictions\n",
      "would be useful for you to save you a lot of time\n",
      "in the wet lab, right? That would be the dream. Maybe you could 100X speed up experiments by doing most of it in silico, the search in silico, and then you do the validation\n",
      "step in the wet lab. That would be, that's the dream. And so, but maybe now, finally, so I was trying to build these components, AlphaFold being one, that would allow you eventually to model the full interaction, a\n",
      "full simulation of a cell. And I'd probably start with a yeast cell. And partly that's what Paul Nurse studied because the yeast cell\n",
      "is like a full organism that's a single cell, right? So it's the kind of simplest\n",
      "single cell organism. And so it's not just a\n",
      "cell, it's a full organism. And yeast is very well understood. And so that would be a good candidate for a kind of full simulated model. Now AlphaFold is the\n",
      "solution to the kind of static picture of what\n",
      "does a protein look, a 3D structure protein look like, a static picture of it. But we know that biology, all the interesting things happen with the dynamics, the interactions. And that's what AlphaFold 3\n",
      "is the first step towards is modeling those interactions. So first of all, pairwise, you know, proteins with proteins, proteins with RNA and DNA, but then the next step after that would be modeling maybe a whole pathway, maybe like the TOR pathway\n",
      "that's involved in cancer or something like this. And then eventually you\n",
      "might be able to model, you know, a whole cell. - Also, there's another complexity here that stuff in a cell happens\n",
      "at different timescales. Is that tricky? Like they're, you know, protein folding is, you know, super fast. - [Demis] Yes. - I don't know all the\n",
      "biological mechanisms, - Yeah.\n",
      "- but some of them take a long time.\n",
      "- Yeah. - And so that's a level, so the levels of interaction has a different temporal scale\n",
      "- Yeah. - that you have to be able to model. - So that would be hard. So you'd probably need\n",
      "several simulated systems that can interact at these\n",
      "different temporal dynamics, or at least maybe it's\n",
      "like a hierarchical system so you can jump up or down\n",

      "something like a move 37, so on the positive side,\n",
      "- Yeah. - versus like a barrage\n",
      "of 10,000 cognitive tasks. - Yeah.\n",
      "- where it'll be one or two where it's like,\n",
      "- Yes. - holy shit, this is special.\n",
      "- So I think there are. Exactly. So I think there's the\n",
      "sort of blanket testing to just make sure you've\n",
      "got the consistency. But I think there are the\n",
      "sort of lighthouse moments like the move 37 that\n",
      "I would be looking for. So one would be inventing a new conjecture or a new\n",
      "hypothesis about physics like Einstein did. So maybe you could even\n",
      "run the back test of that very rigorously. Like have a cutoff, a\n",
      "knowledge cutoff of 1900 and then give the system\n",
      "everything that was, you know, that was written up to 1900, and then see if it could come up with special relativity and\n",
      "general relativity, right, like Einstein did. That would be an interesting test. Another one would be, can\n",
      "it invent a game like Go? Not just come up with\n",
      "move 37, a new strategy, but can it invent a game that's as deep, as aesthetically beautiful,\n",
      "as elegant as Go? And those are the sorts of things I would be looking out for. And probably a system being able to do several of those things, right? For it to be very general,\n",
      "not just one domain. And so I think that would\n",
      "be the signs at least that I would be looking for, that we've got a system that's AGI level. And then maybe to fill that out, you would also check their consistency, you know, make sure there's no\n",
      "holes in that system either. - Yeah, something like a new conjecture or scientific discovery. That would be a cool feeling. - Yeah, that would be amazing. So it's not just helping us do that, but actually coming up\n",
      "with something brand new. - And you would be in the room for that. - Absolutely.\n",
      "- So it would be like probably two or three\n",
      "months before announcing it. And you would just be sitting\n",

      "- Right. And validate it and kind\n",
      "of go through its workings, and I guess it would be\n",
      "explaining its workings too. Yeah, it'd be an amazing moment. - Do you worry that we as\n",
      "humans, even expert humans, like you might miss it? - Well, it may be pretty complicated. So it could be, the\n",
      "analogy I give there is I don't think it will\n",
      "be totally mysterious to the best human scientists, but it may be a bit like, for example, in chess, if I was to talk to Garry\n",
      "Kasparov or Magnus Carlson and play a game with them and they make a brilliant move, I might not be able to\n",
      "come up with that move, but they could explain why\n",
      "afterwards that move made sense. And we would be to\n",
      "understand it to some degree, not to the level they do, but in, you know, if they\n",
      "were good at explaining, which is actually part\n",
      "of intelligence too, is being able to explain in a simple way what you're thinking about. I think that that will be very possible for the best human scientists. - But I wonder, maybe you can\n",
      "educate me on the side of Go, I wonder if there's moves\n",
      "from Magnus or Garry where they at first will\n",
      "dismiss it as a bad move. - Yeah, sure. It could be. But then afterwards they'll\n",
      "figure out with their intuition that this is why this works. And then empirically, the nice thing about games is, one of the great things about games is it's a sort of scientific test. Do you win the game or not win? And then that tells you, okay, that move in the end was good, that strategy was good. And then you can go back and analyze that and explain even to yourself a little bit more why explore around it. And that's how chess analysis\n",
      "and things like that works. So perhaps that's why my\n",

      "contention that's happening where I might at first identify a set of generated code as incorrect in some interesting nuanced ways. But then I'm always have\n",
      "to ask the question, is there a deeper insight here that I'm the one who's incorrect? And that's going to, as the systems get more\n",
      "and more intelligent, you're gonna have to contend with that. It's like, what do you? Is this a bug or a feature,\n",
      "- Yeah. - what you just came up with? - Yeah, and they're gonna\n",
      "be pretty complicated to do, but of course it will be. You can imagine also AI systems that are producing that\n",
      "code or whatever that is, and then human program is looking at it, but also not unaided with\n",

      "- but AlphaEvolve, super cool. So AlphaEvolve enables,\n",
      "on the programming side, something like recursive\n",
      "self-improvement potentially. Like if you can imagine\n",
      "what that AGI system, maybe not the first version, but a few versions beyond that, what does that actually look like? Do you think it will be simple? Do you think it'll be something like a self-improving program and a simple one? - I mean, potentially\n",

      "to this idea of like invent a game as good as Go, right? Imagine that was the prompt. That's pretty underspecified. And so the current systems wouldn't know, I think what to do with that, how to narrow that down\n",
      "to something tractable. And I think there's similar like, look, just make a better\n",
      "version of yourself. That's too unconstrained. But we've done it in, you know, and as you know with AlphaEvolve like things like faster matrix multiplication. So when you hone it down to very specific thing you want, it's very good at\n",
      "incrementally improving that. But at the moment, these are more like\n",
      "incremental improvements, sort of small iterations. Whereas if, you know, if you wanted a big leap in understanding, you need a much larger advance. - Yeah, but it could also be sort of to push back against\n",
      "hard takeoff scenario, it could be just a sequence\n",
      "of incremental improvements like matrix multiplication. Like it has to sit there for days thinking how to\n",
      "incrementally improve a thing and that it does so recursively. And as you do more and more\n",
      "improvement, it'll slow down. - Right.\n",
      "- So there'll be like, like the path to AGI won't be like, it'll be a gradual improvement over time. - Yes. If it was just incremental improvements, that's how it would look. So the question is, could it come up with a new leap like the Transformers architecture?\n",
      "- Yeah. - Right, could it have\n",
      "done that back in 2017, when, you know, we did\n",
      "it and Brain did it. And it's not clear that these systems, something AlphaEvolve\n",
      "wouldn't be able to do make such a big leap. So for sure these systems are good. We have systems I think that can do incremental hill climbing. And that's a kind of bigger question about is that all that's needed from here or do we actually need one or\n",
      "two more big breakthroughs? - And can the same kind of systems provide the breakthroughs also? So make it a bunch of S-curves. Like incremental improvement, but also every once in a while leaps. - Yeah, I don't think anyone has systems that can have shown unequivocally\n",
      "those big leaps, right? We have a lot of systems that do the hill climbing of the S-curve\n",
      "that you're currently on. - Yeah, and that would be the move 37. - Yeah, I think would be a\n",
      "leap, something like that. - Do you think the scaling\n",
      "laws are holding strong on the pre-training,\n",
      "post-training test on compute? Do you, on the flip side of that, anticipate AI progress hitting a wall? - We certainly feel\n",
      "there's a lot more room just in the scaling. So actually all steps, pre-training, post-training,\n",
      "and infant time. So there's sort of three scalings that are happening concurrently. And we, again, there it's about\n",
      "how innovative you can be. And we, you know, we pride ourselves on having the broadest and deepest research bench. We have amazing, you know,\n",
      "incredible researchers and people like Noam Shazeer, who, you know, came up with Transformers, and Dave Silver, you know, who led the AlphaGo project and so on. And it's that research base means that if some new breakthrough is required, like an AlphaGo or Transformers, I would back us to be\n",
      "the place that does that. So I'm actually quite like it when the terrain gets harder, right? Because then it veers\n",
      "more from just engineering to true research.\n",
      "- Yeah. - And you know, or\n",
      "research plus engineering, and that's our sweet spot. And I think that's harder, it's harder to invent things\n",
      "than to, you know, fast follow. And so, you know, we don't know. I would say it's kind of 50/50\n",
      "whether new things are needed or whether the scaling\n",
      "of the existing stuff is gonna be enough. And so in true kind of empirical fashion, we are pushing both of\n",

      "different version of Gemini. - That's interesting the way you put it in terms of the Deep bench, that if progress towards AGI is more than just scaling compute, so the engineering side of the problem and is more on the scientific side where there's breakthroughs needed, then you feel confident DeepMind as well, Google DeepMind as well positioned to - Yes.\n",

      "- Yeah, yeah. - How crucial is the scaling\n",
      "of compute to building AGI? This is a question that's\n",
      "an engineering question, it's almost a geopolitical question because it also integrated into that is supply chains and energy.\n",

      "- Yes. - So innovating on the side of energy also.\n",
      "- Yeah. - Do you think we're gonna\n",
      "keep scaling compute? - I think so, for several reasons. I think compute, there's the amount of compute\n",
      "you have for training, often it needs to be co-located. So actually even like, you know, bandwidth constraints between\n",
      "data centers can affect that. So there's additional\n",
      "constraints even there. And that's important for training obviously the largest models you can. But there's also, because now AI systems are in products and being used by billions\n",
      "of people around the world, you need a ton of inference compute now. And then on top of that, there's the thinking systems, the new paradigm of the last year that where they get smarter, the longer amount of inference time you give them at test time. So all of those things\n",
      "need a lot of compute and I don't really see that slowing down. And as AI systems become better, they'll become more useful and there'll be more demand for them. So both from the training side, the training side actually is\n",

      "in building AI systems and we have done the\n",

      "containment fusion reactors. We've done lots of work on\n",
      "that with Commonwealth Fusion. And also one could imagine reactor design. And then material design I think is one of the most exciting. New types of solar material,\n",
      "solar panel material, room temperature superconductors has always been on my list\n",
      "of dream breakthroughs, and optimal batteries. And I think a solution to any, you know, one of those things would be absolutely revolutionary for, you know, climate and energy usage. And we're probably close, you know, and again, in the next five years, to having AI systems\n",
      "that can materially help with those problems. - If you were to bet, sorry for the ridiculous question. - Yeah.\n",
      "- But what is the main source of energy\n",
      "in like 20, 30, 40 years? Do you think it's gonna be nuclear fusion? - I think fusion and solar are\n",
      "the two that I would bet on. Solar, I mean, you know, it's the fusion reactor\n",
      "in the sky of course. And I think really the problem there is batteries and transmission. So you know, as well as more efficient, more and more efficient solar material, perhaps eventually, you know, in space. You know, these kind of\n",
      "Dyson sphere type ideas. And fusion I think is\n",
      "definitely doable seems if we have the right design of reactor and we can control the\n",
      "plasma fast enough and so on. I think both of those things\n",

      "free and renewable and clean, then that solves a whole\n",
      "bunch of other problems. So for example, the water\n",
      "access problem goes away because you can just use desalination. We have the technology,\n",
      "it's just too expensive. So only, you know,\n",

      "that have a coast could. But also you'd have unlimited rocket fuel. You could just separate sea water out into hydrogen and oxygen using energy, and that's rocket fuel. So combined with, you know, Elon's amazing self-landing rockets, then it could be like sort of\n",
      "like a bus service to space. So that opens up, you know, incredible new resources and domains. Asteroid mining I think\n",

No, it won't solve all problems because there's still other human foibles that will still exist, but it will at least remove one I think one of the big vectors, which is scarcity of resources, you know, including land and\n",

      "- Actually the hot war. So maybe we can figure out increasingly sophisticated\n",

      "like to use it viscerally and having good taste\n",
      "coming back to earlier. The same thing that's useful in science I think can also be\n",
      "useful in product design. And I've just had a very, you know, always been a sort of\n",

      "creativity capability. - What are some specific things\n",
      "you kind of learned about when you, even on the LLM side, you're interacting with Gemini, you're like this doesn't feel like the layout, the interface,\n",
      "- Yeah. - maybe the trade\n",
      "opportunity, the latency. Like how to present to\n",
      "the user how long to wait and how that waiting is shown\n",
      "or the reasoning capabilities? There some interesting things. 'Cause like you said,\n",
      "it's very cutting edge, we don't know\n",
      "- Yeah. - how to present it correctly. So is there some specific\n",
      "things you've learned? - I mean it's such a false evolving space. We're evaluating this all the time. But where we are today is that you want to continually simplify things. Whether that's the interface,\n",
      "- Simplify, yeah. - or what you build on top of the model. You kind of wanna get out\n",
      "of the way of the model. The model train is coming down the track and it's improving unbelievably fast. This relentless progress\n",
      "we talked about earlier. You know, you look at 2.5 versus 1.5 and it's just a gigantic improvement. And we expect that again\n",
      "for the future versions. And so the models are\n",

      "I'm dreaming about now can't be done today, but is the research track on schedule to basically intercept that in\n",
      "six months or a year's time? So you kind of got to intercept where this highly changing\n",
      "technology's going. As well as the new capabilities are coming online all the time, that you didn't realize\n",
      "before that can allow like deep research to work. Or now we've got video generation, what do we do with that? This multimodal stuff, you know, one question I have is, is it really going to be the\n",

      "on the product side as well as the research side. - And then we are offline\n",
      "talking about the keyboard, the open question is how, when, and how much will we move to audio as the primary way of interacting with the machines around\n",
      "us versus typing stuff. - Yeah, I mean typing is a very\n",
      "low bandwidth way of doing, even if you're a very\n",
      "fast, you know, typer. And I think we are gonna have to start utilizing other devices, whether that's smart glasses,\n",

      "sorts of neural devices where we can increase the\n",
      "input and the output bandwidth to something, you know,\n",
      "maybe 100X of what is today. - I think that, you know, underappreciated art form\n",
      "is the interface design because I think you can not unlock the power of the intelligence of a system if you don't have the right interface. The interface is really the way you unlock its power.\n",
      "- Yeah. - It's such an interesting\n",
      "question of how to do that. - Yeah.\n",
      "- So how. You would think like\n",
      "getting out of the way isn't real art form. - Yes. You know, it's the sort of thing that I guess Steve Jobs\n",
      "always talked about, right? It's simplicity, beauty, and\n",
      "elegance that we want, right? And nobody's there yet, in my opinion. And that's what I would like us to get to. Again, it sort of speaks to\n",
      "like Go again, right, as a game, the most elegant, beautiful game. Can you, you know, can you make an interface\n",
      "as beautiful as that? And actually I think we're gonna enter an era\n",
      "of AI-generated interfaces that are probably personalized to you. So it fits the way that\n",
      "your aesthetic, your feel, the way that your brain works. And the AI kind of generates that depending on the task, you know. That feels like that's probably the direction we'll end up in. - Yeah, 'cause some people are power users and they want every single parameter on the screen.\n",
      "- Right. - And everything based\n",

      "to go from 2.5 to 3.0? Because it seems like there's been a lot of releases of 2.5, which are already leaps in performance. So what does it even mean\n",
      "to go to a new version? Is it about performance? Is it about a complete different\n",
      "flavor of an experience? - Yeah, well so the way it works with our different version numbers is, you know, we try to collect, so maybe it takes, you know, roughly six months or something\n",
      "to do a new kind of full run and the full productization\n",
      "of a new version. And during that time, lots of new interesting research, iterations, and ideas come up. And we sort of collect them all together. You know, you could imagine\n",

And we collect, package that all up, test which ones are likely to be useful for the next iteration, and then bundle that all together. And then we start the new, you know, giant hero training run, right? And then of course that gets monitored. And then at the end of the pre-training, then there's all the post-training, there's many different ways of doing that, different ways of patching it. So there's a whole\n",
      "experimenting phase there, which you can also get a lot of gains out. And that's where you see the version numbers usually are\n",

      "versions of 2.5, you know, and the different sizes and\n",
      "the different little additions, they're often patches\n",
      "or post-training ideas that can be done afterwards off the same basic architecture. And then of course on top of that, we also have different sizes, Pro and Flash and Flash-Lite. that are often distilled\n",
      "from the biggest ones. You know, the Flash\n",

      "range of different choices if you are the developer of do you wanna prioritize\n",
      "performance or speed, right, and cost? And we like to think of\n",
      "this Pareto frontier of, you know, on the one hand the y-axis is, you know, like performance, and then the x-axis is, you know, cost or latency\n",
      "and speed basically. And we have models that\n",
      "completely define the frontier. So whatever your trade off is that you want as an individual\n",
      "user or as a developer, you should find one of our\n",
      "models satisfies that constraint. - So behind the version changes\n",
      "there is a big hero run. - Yes.\n",
      "- And then, there's just an insane\n",
      "complexity of productization, then there's the distillation of the different sizes\n",
      "along that Pareto front. And then with each step you take, you realize there might be a cool product. There's side quests. - Yes, exactly. - And then you also don't want\n",
      "to take too many side quests because then you have a million versions and a million products.\n",
      "- Yes, yes, precisely. - It's very unclear.\n",
      "- Yeah. - But you also get super excited 'cause it's super cool.\n",
      "- Yup. - Like how does, even\n",
      "when you look at Veo, it's very cool.\n",
      "- Yeah. - How does it fit into the bigger thing? - Yes, exactly.\n",
      "- Yeah. - Exactly, and then you're constantly this process of converging\n",
      "upstream, we call it, you know, ideas from the product surfaces or from the post-training. And even further downstream than that, you kind of upstream that\n",
      "into the core model training for the next run. Right, so then the main model, the main Gemini track becomes\n",
      "more and more general. And eventually, you know, AGI. - One hero run at a time.\n",
      "- Yes, exactly. - A few hero runs later. - Yeah. So sometimes when you\n",
      "release these new versions or every version really, are benchmarks productive\n",
      "or counterproductive for showing the performance of a model? - You need them, but it's important that you\n",
      "don't over fit to them, right? So there shouldn't be the end\n",
      "or the be-all and end-all. So there's LM Arena or it used to be called LMSYS, that's one of them that turned\n",
      "out sort of organically to be one of the main ways people\n",
      "like to test these systems, at least the chatbots. Obviously there's loads\n",
      "of academic benchmarks from that test, mathematics and coding ability, general language ability,\n",
      "science ability, and so on. And then we have our\n",
      "own internal benchmarks that we care about. It's a kind of multiobjective, you know, optimization problem, right? You don't want to be\n",
      "good at just one thing. We're trying to build general systems that are good across the board. And you try and make\n",
      "no regret improvements. So where you're improving - Yeah.\n",
      "- like, you know, coding, but it doesn't reduce your performance in other areas, right? So that's the hard part. 'Cause you can, of course, you could put more coding\n",
      "data in or you could put more, I don't know, gaming data in, but then does it make\n",
      "worse your language system or in your translation systems and other things that you care about? So you've got to kind of\n",
      "continually monitor this increasingly larger and\n",
      "larger suite of benchmarks. And also there's, when you stick them into\n",
      "products, these models, you also care about the direct\n",
      "usage and the direct stats and the signals that you're\n",
      "getting from the end users. Whether they're coders\n",
      "or the average person using the chat interfaces. - Yeah, because ultimately you\n",
      "wanna measure the usefulness, but it's so hard to\n",
      "convert that into a number. - Right.\n",
      "- It's really vibe-based benchmarks\n",
      "- Yes. - across a large number of users, and it's hard to know. And it would be just terrifying to me to, you know you have a much smarter model, but it's just something vibe-based. It's not quite working. That's just scary. And everything you just said, it has to be smart and useful\n",
      "across so many domains. So you get super excited 'cause it's all of a sudden\n",
      "solving programming problems that never been able to solve before, but now it's crappy at\n",
      "poetry or something. - Yes, right.\n",
      "- And it's just, I don't know. That's a stressful. That's so difficult.\n",
      "- To balance, yeah. - To balance. And because you can't\n",
      "really trust the benchmarks, you really have to trust the end users. - Yeah. And then other things that even more esoteric\n",
      "come into play like, you know, the style of\n",
      "the persona of the system, you know, how it, you know. Is it verbose? Is it succinct? Is it humorous, you know? And different people\n",
      "like different things. - Yeah.\n",
      "- So, you know, it's very interesting. It's almost like cutting-edge\n",
      "part of psychology research or personality research. You know, I used to do that in my PhD, like five-factor personality. What do we actually want\n",
      "our systems to be like? And different people will\n",
      "like different things as well. So these are all just sort of\n",
      "new problems in product space that I don't think have ever\n",
      "really been tackled before. But we're gonna sort of\n",
      "rapidly have to deal with now. - I think it's a super fascinating space, developing the character of the thing. - [Demis] Yeah. - And so doing, it puts\n",
      "a mirror to ourselves. What are the kind of things that we like? 'Cause prompt engineering\n",
      "allows you to control a lot of those elements, but can the product make it easier for you to control the different\n",
      "flavors of those experiences, the different characters\n",
      "that you interact with? - Yeah, exactly so. - So what's the probability\n",
      "of Google DeepMind winning? - Well, I don't see it sort of winning. I mean I think we need to, I think winning is the\n",
      "wrong way to look at it given how important and consequential what it is we're building. So funnily enough, I try not to view it like\n",
      "a game or competition, even though that's a lot of my mindset. It's about, in my view, all of us have, those of\n",
      "us at the leading edge, have a responsibility to steward this unbelievable technology that could be used for incredible good but also has risks, steward it safely into the world for the benefit of humanity. That's always what I've dreamed about and what we've always tried to do. And I hope that's what\n",
      "eventually the community, maybe the international\n",
      "community will rally around when it becomes obvious as we\n",
      "get closer and closer to AGI, that that's what's needed. - I agree with you. I think that's beautifully put. You've said that you talk to\n",
      "and are on good terms with the leads of some of these labs. As the competition heats up, how hard is it to maintain\n",
      "sort of those relationships? - It's been okay so far. I try to pride myself\n",
      "in being collaborative. I'm a collaborative person. Research is a collaborative endeavor. Science is a collaborative\n",
      "endeavor, right? It's all good for humanity in the end. If you cure, you know, terrible diseases and you come with an incredible cure, this is net win for humanity. And the same with energy. All of the things that I'm interested in in helping solve with AI. So I just want that technology\n",
      "to exist in the world and be used for the right things and the kind of the benefits of that, the productivity benefits\n",
      "of that being shared for the benefit of everyone. So I try to maintain good relations with all the leading lab people. They're very interesting\n",
      "characters many of them as you might expect.\n",
      "- Yeah. - But yeah, I'm on good terms I hope with pretty much all of them. And I think that's gonna be important when things get even more\n",
      "serious than they are now, that there are those\n",
      "communication channels and that's what will facilitate\n",
      "cooperation or collaboration if that's what is required especially on things like safety. - Yeah, I hope there's\n",
      "some collaboration on stuff that's sort of less high stakes. And in so doing sort of as a mechanism for maintaining friendships\n",
      "and relationships. So for example, I think\n",
      "the internet would love it if you and Elon somehow collaborate on creating a video game, that kind of thing.\n",
      "- Right. - That I think that enables\n",
      "camaraderie in good terms. And also you two are legit gamers, so it's just fun to,\n",
      "- Yeah. - fun to create something.\n",
      "- Yeah, that would be awesome. And we've talked about that in the past and it may be a cool thing\n",
      "that, you know, we can do. And I agree with you. It'd be nice to have kind\n",
      "of side projects in a way where one can just lean into\n",
      "the collaboration aspect of it and it's a sort of a\n",
      "win-win for both sides. And it kind of builds up\n",
      "that collaborative muscle. - I see the scientific endeavor\n",
      "as that kind of side project for humanity.\n",
      "- Yeah. - And I think Google DeepMind\n",
      "has been really pushing that. I would love to see other labs do more scientific stuff\n",
      "and then collaborate. 'Cause it just seems like\n",
      "easier to collaborate on the big scientific questions. - I agree, and I would love\n",
      "to see a lot of people, a lot of the other labs\n",
      "talk about science, but I think, we are really the only ones,\n",
      "- Yeah. - using it for science and doing that. And that's why projects like AlphaFold are so important to me. And I think to our mission\n",
      "is to show how AI can, you know, be clearly used\n",
      "in a very concrete way for the benefit of humanity. And also we spun out\n",
      "companies like Isomorphic off the back of AlphaFold\n",
      "to do drug discovery and it's going really well. And build sort of, you know, you can think of build\n",
      "additional AlphaFold type systems to go into chemistry space to\n",
      "help accelerate drug design. And the examples I think we need to show and society needs to understand are where AI can bring these huge benefits. - Well, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for pushing the\n",
      "scientific efforts forward with rigor, with fun,\n",
      "with humility, all of it. I just love to see it, and still talking about P equals NP I mean it is just incredible. So I love it. There's been seemingly a war for talent. Some of it is meme, I don't know. What do you think about Meta buying up talent with huge salaries and the heating up of\n",
      "this battle for talent? And I should say that I think\n",
      "a lot of people see DeepMind as a really great place\n",
      "to do cutting-edge work for the reasons that you've outlined. - Yeah.\n",
      "- Like there's this vibrant scientific culture. - Yeah, well, look, of course, you know, there's a strategy that\n",
      "Meta is taking right now, I think that from my perspective at least, I think the people that are real believers in the mission of AGI and what it can do and understand the real consequences, both good and bad from that and what that responsibility entails, I think they're mostly\n",
      "doing it to be like myself, to be on the frontier of that research. So, you know, they can help influence the way that goes and steward that technology\n",
      "safely into the world. And, you know, Meta right\n",
      "now are not at the frontier. Maybe they'll manage to get back on there. And you know, it's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and\n",
      "they need to do something. But I think there's more\n",
      "important things than just money. Of course one has to\n",
      "pay, you know, people, their market rates and all of these things and that continues to go up. But, and I was expecting this, because more and more\n",
      "people are finally realizing leaders of companies, what I've always known\n",
      "for 30 plus years now, which is that AGI is the\n",
      "most important technology probably that's ever gonna be invented. So in some sense it's\n",
      "rational to be doing that. But I also think there's\n",
      "a much bigger question. I mean, people in AI these\n",
      "days are very well paid. You know, I remember when we\n",
      "were starting out back in 2010, you know, I didn't even pay\n",
      "myself a couple of years because it wasn't enough money, we couldn't raise any money. And these days interns\n",
      "are being paid, you know, the amount that we raised as\n",
      "our first entire seed round. So it's pretty funny. And I remember the days where I used to have to work for free and almost pay my own way\n",
      "to do an internship, right? Now it's all the other way around. But that's just how it is. It's the new world. But I think that, you know, we've been discussing\n",
      "like what happens post AGI and energy systems are solved and so on, what is even money going to mean? So I think, you know, and the economy, and we're gonna have much\n",
      "bigger issues to work through and how does the economy\n",
      "function in that world, and companies. So I think, you know, it's a little bit of a side issue about salaries and things\n",
      "of like that today. - Yeah when you're facing\n",
      "such gigantic consequences and gigantic fascinating scientific questions.\n",
      "- Right. Which may be only a few years away so. - So on the practical\n",
      "sort of pragmatic sense, if we zoom in on jobs, we can look at programmers\n",
      "because it seems like AI systems are currently doing incredibly well at programming\n",
      "and increasingly so. So a lot of people that\n",
      "program for a living, love programming are worried\n",
      "they will lose their jobs. How worried should they be, do you think? And what's the right way to sort of adjust to the new reality and ensure that you survive\n",
      "and thrive as a human in the programming world? - Well, it's interesting that programming, and it's again, counterintuitive to what\n",
      "we thought years ago maybe, that some of the skills that\n",
      "we think of as harder skills are turned out maybe to be the easier ones for various reasons. But, you know, coding and math because you can create\n",
      "a lot of synthetic data and verify if that data's correct. So because of that nature of that, it's easier to make things like synthetic data to train from. It's also an area, of course,\n",
      "we're all interested in, 'cause as programmers, right, to help us and get faster\n",
      "at it and more productive. So I think for the next era, like the next five, 10 years, I think what we're gonna find\n",
      "is people who are kind of embrace these technologies\n",
      "become almost at one with them. Whether that's in the creative industries or the technical industries will become sort of\n",
      "superhumanly productive I think. So the great programs will be even better, but there'll be even 10X\n",
      "even what they are today. And because there, you'll be able to use their skills to utilize the tools to the maximum, you know, exploit them to the maximum. And so I think that's what we're gonna see in the next domain. So that's gonna cause quite\n",
      "a lot of change, right? And so that's coming. A lot of people benefit from that. So I think one example of that is if coding becomes easier, it becomes available to many\n",
      "more creatives to do more. But I think the top programmers will still have huge advantages\n",
      "as terms of specifying, going back to specifying what\n",
      "the architecture should be, the question should be, how to guide these coding\n",
      "assistants in a way that's useful, you know, check whether the\n",
      "code they produce is good. So I think there's\n",
      "plenty of headroom there for the foreseeable, you\n",
      "know, next few years. - So I think there's several\n",
      "interesting things there. One is there's a lot of imperative to just get better and\n",
      "better consistently of using these tools. So they're like riding the wave of the improving models,\n",
      "- Yes. - versus like competing against them. - Yes.\n",
      "- But sadly, because the nature of life on Earth, there could be a huge amount of value to certain kinds of\n",
      "programming at the cutting edge and less value to other kinds. For example, it could be like, you know, frontend web design might\n",
      "be more amenable to, as you mentioned, to\n",
      "generation by AI systems. And maybe for example, game engine design or something like this,\n",
      "- Yeah. - or backend design, or guiding systems in\n",
      "high-performance situations, high-performance programming\n",
      "type of design decisions, that might be extremely valuable. But it will shift,\n",
      "- Yeah. - where the humans are needed most. And that's scary for people to address.\n",
      "- Yeah, I think that's right. Anytime where there's a lot\n",
      "of disruption and change, you know, and we've had this, it is not just this time, we've had this many times in human history with the internet, mobile, but before that obviously\n",
      "industrial revolution. And it's gonna be one of those eras where there will be a lot of change. I think there'll be new jobs\n",
      "we can't even imagine today just like the internet created. And then those people\n",
      "with the right skill sets to ride that wave will become\n",
      "incredibly valuable, right, those skills. But maybe people will have to relearn or adapt a bit\n",
      "their current skills. And the thing that's gonna\n",
      "be harder to deal with this time around is that I think what we're gonna see is something like probably 10 times the impact the industrial revolution had but 10 times faster as well, right? So instead of a hundred\n",
      "years, it takes 10 years. And so that's gonna make it, you know, it's like 100X the impact\n",
      "and the speed combined. So that's what's I think gonna make it more difficult for society to deal with. And there's a lot to think through and I think we need to be\n",
      "discussing that right now. And, I, you know, encourage top economists in\n",
      "the world and philosophers to start thinking about how is society gonna be affected by this and what should we do? Including things like, you know, universal basic provision\n",
      "or something like that where a lot of the increased productivity gets shared out and distributed to society and maybe in the form of surface\n",
      "services and other things, where if you want more than that, you still go and get some\n",
      "incredibly rare skills and things like that, and make yourself unique, but there's a basic\n",
      "provision that is provided. - And if you think of\n",
      "government as a technology, there's also interesting questions, not just in the economics\n",
      "but just politics. How do you design a\n",
      "system that's responding to the rapidly changing times such that you can represent\n",
      "the different pain that people feel from\n",
      "the different groups? And how do you reallocate resources in a way that addresses that pain and represents the hope and the pain and the fears of different people in a way that doesn't lead to division? 'Cause politicians are\n",
      "often really good at sort of fueling the division and using that to get elected. Defining the other and then saying, that's bad.\n",
      "- Yeah. - And sort of based on that, I think that's often counterproductive to leveraging a rapidly\n",
      "changing technology, how to help the world flourish. So we almost need to improve our political systems as well rapidly, if you think of them as a technology. - Definitely. And I think we'll need\n",
      "new governance structures, institutions probably, to help with this transition. So I think political philosophy\n",
      "and political science is gonna be key to that. But I think the number\n",
      "one thing, first of all, that is to create more\n",
      "abundance of resources, right? So that's the number one thing, increase productivity, get more resources, maybe eventually get out\n",
      "of the zero-sum situation. Then the second question is how to use those resources and\n",
      "distribute those resources. But yeah, you can't do that without\n",
      "having that abundance first. - You mentioned to me the book \"The Maniac\" by Benjamin Labatut, a book on, first of all, about you, there's a bio about you. - It's strange, yeah. - It's unclear, yes, sure. It's unclear how much is\n",
      "fiction, how much is reality. But I think the central figure\n",
      "that is John von Neumann. I would say it's a haunting and beautiful exploration of madness and genius and let's say the double-edged\n",
      "sword of discovery. And you know, for people who don't know, John von Neumann is a\n",
      "kind of legendary mind. He contributed to quantum mechanics. He was on the Manhattan Project. He is widely considered to\n",
      "be the father of or pioneer the modern computer and AI and so on. Many people say he's like one\n",
      "of the smartest humans ever, which is fascinating. And what's also fascinating is that as a person who saw\n",
      "nuclear science and physics become the atomic bomb, so you got to see ideas become a thing that has a huge amount\n",
      "of impact on the world, he also foresaw the same\n",
      "thing for computing. - [Demis] Yeah. - And that's the a little bit, again, beautiful and\n",
      "haunting aspect of the book. Then taking a leap forward and looking at this at\n",
      "least at all, AlphaZero, AlphaGo, AlphaZero big moment that maybe John von Neumann's thinking was brought to reality. So I guess the question\n",
      "is what do you think if you got to hang out\n",
      "with John von Neumann now, what would he say about what's going on? - Well, that would be\n",
      "an amazing experience. You know, he is a fantastic mind. And I also love the way\n",
      "he spent a lot of his time at Princeton at the Institute\n",
      "of Advanced Studies, a very special place for thinking. And it's amazing how\n",
      "much of a polymath he was and the spread of things he helped invent, including of course the\n",
      "Von Neumann architecture that all the modern\n",
      "computers are based on. And he had amazing foresight. I think he would've\n",
      "loved where we are today. And he would've, I think he would've really\n",
      "enjoyed AlphaGo being a, you know, a game. - Yes.\n",
      "- He also did game theory. I think he foresaw a\n",
      "lot of what would happen with learning machines systems that are kind of grown\n",
      "I think he called it rather than programmed. I'm not sure how even maybe he wouldn't even be that surprised. There's the fruition of what\n",
      "I think he already foresaw in the 1950s. - I wonder what advice he would give. He got to see the building\n",
      "of the atomic bomb with the Manhattan Project.\n",
      "- Yeah. - I'm sure there's interesting stuff that maybe is not talked about enough. Maybe some bureaucratic aspect, maybe the influence of politicians, maybe not enough of picking up the phone and talking to people\n",
      "that are called enemies by the said politicians. There might be some like deep wisdom that we just may have lost\n",
      "from that time actually. - Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure there is. I mean, I've you know, studied, I read a lot of books\n",
      "at that time as a well, chronicle time, and some brilliant people involved. But I agree with you. I think maybe there needs to be more dialogue and understanding. I hope we can learn from those times. I think the difference here\n",
      "is that the AI has so many, it's a multi-use technology. Obviously we're trying to do things like solve, you know, all diseases, help with energy and scarcity,\n",
      "these incredible things, this is why all of us\n",
      "and myself, you know, I worked started on this\n",
      "journey 30 plus years ago. But of course there are risks too. And probably Von Neumann,\n",
      "my guess is he foresaw both. And I think he sort of said, I think it to his wife that it would be, that computers would be even\n",
      "more impactful in the world. And as we just discussed, you know, I think that's right. I think it's gonna be 10 times at least of the industrial revolution. So I think he's right. So I think he would've been, I imagine, fascinated by where we are now. - And I think one of the, maybe you can correct me, but one of the takeaways\n",
      "from the book is that reason as said in the book, mad dreams of reason, it's not enough for guiding humanity as we build these super\n",
      "powerful technology that there's something else. I mean, there's also like\n",
      "a religious component. Whatever God, whatever religion gives, it pulls us something in the human spirit that raw cold reason doesn't give us. - And I agree with that. I think we need to approach it with whatever you wanna call it, a spiritual dimension\n",
      "or humanist dimension, it doesn't have to be to\n",
      "do with religion, right? But this idea of a soul, what makes us human,\n",
      "the spark that we have, perhaps it's to do with consciousness when we finally understand that, I think that has to be at\n",
      "the heart of the endeavor. And technology, I've always seen technology\n",
      "as the enabler, right? The tools that enable us to flourish and to understand more about the world. And I'm sort of with Feynman on this, and he used to always talk about science and art being companions, right? You can understand it from both sides, the beauty of a flower,\n",
      "how beautiful it is. And also understand why\n",

I always thought the best way, of course one can philosophize about it and have thought experiments and maybe even do actual experiments like you do in neuroscience\n",
      "on real brains, but in the end, I always imagined that building AI a kind of intelligent artifact and then comparing that to the human mind and seeing what the differences were would be the best way to uncover what's special about the human mind, if indeed there is anything special.

      "- Yeah. - It could be. I mean, it's not a very\n",
      "helpful scientific explanation, but I think it's kind of\n",
      "interesting intuitive one. And so, you know, on this journey, this scientific journey we're on will I think help uncover that mystery. - Yeah. \"What I cannot create,\n",

      "first of all, is a computation? And if it is, if it's information processing\n",
      "like you said everything is, is it something that could be modeled by a classical computer?\n",

      "discussions about this. Of course we cordially disagree. Which is, you know, I feel like, I mean he collaborated with\n",
      "a lot of good neuroscientists to see if he could find mechanisms for quantum mechanics\n",
      "behavior in the brain. And to my knowledge, they haven't found\n",
      "anything convincing yet. So my betting is there is that, it's mostly, you know, it is just classical computing\n",
      "that's going on in the brain, which suggests that all the phenomena are modelable or mimicable\n",
      "by a classical computer. But we'll see. You know, there may be this\n",
      "final mysterious things of the feeling of consciousness, the qualia, these kinds of things\n",

      "to feel for ourselves what it's like to compute\n",

      "late Daniel Dennett about why do we think each other are conscious? Okay, so it's for two reasons. One is you're exhibiting\n",
      "the same behavior that I am. So that's one thing, behaviorally you seem like\n",
      "a conscious being if I am. But the second thing which\n",
      "is often overlooked is that we're running on the same substrate. So if you're behaving in the same way and we're running on the same substrate, it's most parsimonious to assume you are feeling the same\n",
      "experience that I'm feeling. But with an AI that's on silicon, we won't be able to\n",
      "rely on the second part. Even if it exhibits the first part, that behavior looks like a\n",
      "behavior of a conscious being. It might even claim it is. But we wouldn't know how it actually felt. And it probably couldn't\n",
      "know what we felt, at least in the first stages. Maybe when we get to super intelligence and the technologies that builds, perhaps we'll be able to bridge that. - No, I mean that's a huge\n",
      "test for radical empathy is to empathize with a different substrate. - Right, exactly. We've never had to confront that before. - Yeah, so maybe,\n",
      "- Yeah. - through brain computer interfaces we'll be able to truly empathize what it feels like to be a computer, to compute. - Well, for information to be computed not on a carbon system. - I mean that's deeply, I mean some people kind of\n",
      "think about that with plants, with other life forms which are different.\n",
      "- Yes, it could be, exactly. - Similar substrate, but\n",
      "sufficiently far enough on the evolutionary tree,\n",

      "dolphins and dogs and monkeys, you know, they have some, and elephants, you know, they have some aspects certainly\n",
      "of consciousness, right? Even though they're not might not be that smart on an IQ sense. So we can already empathize with that. And maybe even some of\n",

      "future of human civilization? - Well, what gives me hope is that I think our almost limitless\n",

      "more wonderful than that, seeing them in their element and flow. I think it's almost limitless. You know, our brains are general systems, intelligent systems. So I think it's almost limitless what we can potentially do with them. And then the other thing is\n",

      "questions, thoughts, and requests from folks. I'll keep trying to pick some randomly and comment on it at the\n",
      "end of every episode. I got a note on May 21st\n",
      "this year that said, hi, Lex, 20 years ago today, David Foster Wallace delivered his famous This is Water\n",
      "speech at Kenyon College. What do you think of this speech? Well, first, I think this is\n",
      "probably one of the greatest and most unique commencement\n",
      "speeches ever given. But of course I have many favorites, including the one by Steve Jobs. And David Foster Wallace is\n",
      "one of my favorite writers and one of my favorite humans. There's a tragic honesty to his work and it always felt as if he was engaging in a constant battle with his own mind. And the writing, his writing, were kind of his notes from\n",
      "the front lines of that battle. Now onto the speech,\n",
      "let me quote some parts. There's of course the parable of the fish and the water that goes. \"There are these two\n",
      "young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys. Hows the water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually, one of them looks over\n",
      "at the other and goes, 'What the hell is water?'\" In the speech, David Foster\n",
      "Wallace goes on to say, \"The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious,\n",
      "important realities are often the ones that are\n",
      "hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence of course, this is just the banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have\n",
      "a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you in this dry and lovely morning.\" I have several takeaways from this parable and\n",
      "the speech that follows. First, I think we must\n",
      "question everything, and in particular, the most basic assumptions\n",
      "about our reality, our life, and the very nature of existence. And that this project is\n",
      "a deeply personal one. In some fundamental sense, nobody can really help you\n",
      "in this process of discovery. The call to action here I\n",
      "think from David Foster Wallace as he puts it is to, quote, \"To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little\n",
      "more critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be\n",
      "automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded.\" All right, back to me, Lex speaking. Second takeaway is that the central spiritual battles\n",
      "of our life are not fought on a mountaintop somewhere\n",
      "at a meditation retreat, but it is fought in the\n",
      "mundane moments of daily life. Third takeaway is that we too easily give away\n",
      "our time and attention to the multitude of distractions\n",
      "that the world feeds us, the insatiable black holes of attention. David Foster Wallace's call\n",
      "to action in this case is to be deeply aware of\n",
      "the beauty in each moment and to find meaning in the mundane. I often quote David Foster\n",
      "Wallace in his advice that the key to life is to be unborable. And I think this is exactly right. Every moment, every\n",
      "object, every experience when looked at closely\n",
      "enough contains within it infinite richness to explore. And since Demis Hassabis of\n",
      "this very podcast episode and I are such fans of Richard Feynman, allow me to also quote Mr.\n",
      "Feynman on this topic as well. Quote, \"I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view, which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say, 'Look how beautiful it is,' and I'll agree. Then he says, 'I, as an artist can see\n",
      "how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.' And I think that's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty\n",
      "that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about\n",
      "the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions\n",
      "inside which also have beauty. I mean, it's not just\n",
      "beauty at this dimension at one centimeter, there's also beauty at\n",
      "the smaller dimensions, their inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors\n",
      "and the flower evolved in order to attract the insects to pollinate it is interesting, it means that the insects\n",
      "can see the color. It adds a question, does this aesthetic sense\n",
      "also exist in lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions, which the science knowledge\n",
      "only adds to the excitement, the mystery, and the awe of a flower. It only adds.\" All right, back to David\n",
      "Foster Wallace's speech. He has a great story in there\n",
      "that I particularly enjoy. It goes, there are these two guys\n",
      "sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious,\n",
      "the other is an atheist. And the two are arguing\n",
      "about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says, look, it's not like I\n",
      "don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month, I got caught away from the\n",
      "camp in that terrible blizzard and I was totally lost\n",
      "and I couldn't see a thing and it was 50 below, and so I tried it. I fell on my knees in\n",
      "the snow and cried out, oh God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard and I'm gonna die if you don't help me. And now back in the bar, the religious guy looks at\n",
      "the atheist all puzzled. Well, then you must believe now, he says. After all, there you are alive. The atheist just rolls his eyes, no man. All that happened was a couple of Eskimos\n",
      "happened to be wandering by and show me the way back to the camp. All this I think teaches us that everything is a matter of perspective and that wisdom may arrive if we have the humility to keep shifting and expanding\n",
      "our perspective on the world. Thank you for allowing me to talk a bit about David Foster Wallace. He's one of my favorite writers\n",
      "and he's a beautiful soul. If I may, one more thing I wanted\n",
      "to briefly comment on. I found myself to be in\n",
      "this strange position of getting attacked online\n",
      "often from all sides, including being lied about sometimes through selective\n",
